# BE-ABC
An improved artificial bee colony algorithm for protein folding optimization

# Environment 
It has been tested under Window 8 with a Matlab R2012a environment.

# Instructions
The `src` folder contains several subfolders with name of protein id from [PDB database](http://www.rcsb.org/).  
Each subfolder contains independent program for optimizating the protein struture using a balance-evolution artificial bee colony (BE-ABC) algorithm.  
Click `runmeLQ.me` to start the optimization.  
Here is an example of the optimization process of protein `1AGT`
